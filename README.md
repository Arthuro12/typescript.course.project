# typescript.course.project

This project is a simple application for managing projects. I did this project as part of the TypeScript course "Understanding TypeScript" by Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller, which can be found on the Udemy platform. The project enabled me to put into practice a number of TypeScript programming notions, such as static typing, interfaces, unionstype, intersections, type guards, generics, etc.
